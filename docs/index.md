# HBCD: Processing and Analytic Software Standards 

The following guidelines are presented to the HBCD pipeline developers and working groups, along with community developers, wishing to include their tools as part of the HBCD release environment. This document is meant to assist with the standardization of HBCD software and  documentation. These guidelines were developed based on principles and utilities developed by [NMIND](https://www.nmind.org/about) to foster reproducibility and standardization of tools within the field of neuroimaging ([Kiar et. al 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01647-0)). This includes the [NMIND Coding Standards Checklist](https://www.nmind.org/standards-checklist/), a rating system to assess the quality of documentation, infrastructure, and testing ability of neuroimaging software. 

Developers should complete the checklist and open a pull request in the [proceedings repository](https://github.com/nmind/proceedings) (with the exported JSON associated with the tool) for external review. Any issues or feature requests should post an issue to the NMIND [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nmind/standards-checklist)\! 

At minimum, equivalent standards to the Bronze badge in the rating system are required. Items not relevant can be ignored/circumvented. For example, providing software dependencies is not as critical because all HBCD software is required to be containerized.  Users can make their  best judgment regarding the relevance of each item to your specific software.

## Documentation

### NMIND Documentation Checklist:

- [ ] Landing page (e.g., GitHub README, website) provides a link to documentation and brief description of what program does  
- [ ] Documentation is up to date with version of software  
- [ ] Typical intended usage is described  
- [ ] An example of its usage is shown  
- [ ] Document functions intended to be used by users (i.e., public function docstring / help coverage ≥ 10%)  
- [ ] Description of required input parameters for user-facing functions with reasonable description of inputs (i.e., "NIfTI of brain mask in MNI" vs. "An image file")  
- [ ] Description of output(s)  
- [ ] User installation instructions available  
- [ ] Dependencies listed (i.e., external and within-language requirements)

### Webpage to Host Living Documentation

In addition to the general guidelines provided by the checklist, we highly encourage living pipeline documentation to be made available via a web page using utilities such as [ReadtheDocs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.com), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/?(null)), [Wiki](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-and-edit-a-wiki-dc64f9c2-d1a2-44b5-ac59-b9d535551a32), etc. This allows for information to stay up-to-date as compared to a publication and also is easier to navigate than a simple GitHub README given the depth of information typically required for image processing pipelines. When writing an initial collaborative draft, we recommend using Google Docs to first solidify the essential content and then convert the documents to whatever format (eg Markdown) is required to upload to the webpage. 

We recommend using the [fMRIPrep ReadtheDocs](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) as a guide for overall organization and what level of detail each section should ideally include. 

## Infrastructure

### NMIND Infrastructure Checklist:

- [ ] Code is open source  
- [ ] Package is under version control  
- [ ] Readme is present  
- [ ] License is present (see more details in following section)  
- [ ] Issues tracking is enabled (i.e., either through GitHub or external site)  
- [ ] Digital Object Identifier (DOI) points to latest version (e.g., Zenodo)  
- [ ] All documented installation instructions can be successfully followed

### Licensing and Obtaining a DOI

All included software will require a [license](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) and also a DOI for software publication. Internal pipelines to HBCD might be leveraged for release data prior to publication. If the pipeline doesn’t yet have an associated scientific article yet that can be cited, we recommend developers obtain a DOI by self-publishing on [Zenodo](https://cdnis-brain.readthedocs.io/zenodo/). Software provided for HBCD releases from non-HBCD PIs will be required to be peer reviewed and published along with the DOI.   
All software will be required to run on BIDS input data or currently available HBCD derivatives as provided in the most current HBCD release. 

### Versioning and New Release Policies

Beyond basic version control in GitHub, developers should also tag new releases that are associated with specific versions of the repository whenever a large update (or large number of updates) has been made. The new tagged release should also include a change log that carefully documents the differences between the new and prior version.

Developers may also wish to decide on a standard release cycle as well as special cases/parameters which warrant a new release (e.g. a serious bug fix that needs to be implemented in version ASAP). Ideally there would be documentation around which versions are expected to receive long-term support vs versions that will be deprecated and the timeline for deprecation.

## Testing Ability

### NMIND Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Provide / generate / point to test data  
- [ ] Provide instructions for users to run tests that include instructions for evaluation for correct behavior

Note that standards for testing ability may not be relevant to or high-priority for all processing pipelines used by HBCD. Additionally, depending on how specialized a given application is for HBCD, making test data openly available that is representative of the workflow is likely not possible.
